Here are some ideas for scripts that could be included in a toolbox to help a pentester perform the first four steps of pentesting (reconnaissance, scanning, enumeration, and vulnerability assessment):

Reconnaissance:

A script that performs reverse DNS lookups to identify the hostnames associated with a given IP address.
A script that uses the whois command to gather information about the owner of a domain or IP address.
A script that uses the dig command to gather DNS records for a given domain.
A script that uses the nmap library to perform a ping sweep of a network, identifying which hosts are online.
Scanning:

A script that uses nmap to perform a port scan of a host, identifying which ports are open and which services are running on those ports.
A script that uses nmap to perform a version scan of a host, identifying the versions of software running on the host.
A script that uses nmap to perform a network scan, identifying the hosts and devices on a network.
A script that uses nmap to perform a vulnerability scan, identifying known vulnerabilities on a host.
Enumeration:

A script that uses nmap to perform a service enumeration, gathering information about the services running on a host.
A script that uses the smbclient command to enumerate shared resources on a host.
A script that uses the ldapclient command to enumerate users and groups on a host.
A script that uses the ftpclient command to enumerate files and directories on a host.
Vulnerability assessment:

A script that uses the nmap library to perform a vulnerability scan, identifying known vulnerabilities on a host.
A script that uses the nessus command to perform a vulnerability scan, identifying known vulnerabilities on a host.
A script that uses the openssl command to test the strength of SSL/TLS certificates on a host.
A script that uses the sqlmap command to perform a SQL injection test on a web application.
